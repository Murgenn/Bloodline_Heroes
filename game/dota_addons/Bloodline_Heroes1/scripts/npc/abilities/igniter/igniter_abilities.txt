// Igniter is a ranged class in BC, fairly squishy with abilities which are straighforward and should be easy to implement
// here we will try to copy igniters abilities, i will list and describe them shortly
// 1	Fireball, a skillshot dealing damage and applying a DOT debuff
// 2	Firestrom, a skillshot shooting 3 fireballs dealing a bit more damage and with a knockback
// 3	Searing Displacement, teleport you to the target location (with a phase period)
// 4	Volcano, pretty much a standard delayed aoe stun
// 5	Crippling fire, a projectile which knocks the target back, further the closer the target are to you
// 6	Living flame, igniter becomes immaterial (like Earthspirits aghs stone) and deals damage when it ends
// 7	Conflageration (ult), igniter flies forward (immortal) and creates a trail of lava behind him
// 8	Firestorm EX, kinda like Phoenixs sunray, dealing damage and applying the DOT
// 9	Crippling fire EX, projectile which bounces once and silences and roots the targets
//
